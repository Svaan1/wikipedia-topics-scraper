# wikipedia-topics-scraper
 (WIP) A web scraper that searches indefinitely for wikipedia topics and stores them in a python graph object (please check db-based branch)

 im not at all satisfied with this but i dont want to overstudy this right now, but i still plan to add some useful features like graph network visualization and some more control over the articles scraped and get some statistics out of the data gathered.
